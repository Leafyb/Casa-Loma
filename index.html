  <h1 id="top">Welcome to Casa Loma: The Castle on the hill</h1>

  <img src="http://libertygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/1.jpg" alt="A picture of Casa Loma at night." width="100%">

  <p class="pp1">
    Casa Loma (Spanish for "Hill House") is a Gothic Revival style mansion and garden in midtown Toronto, Ontario, Canada, that is now a historic house museum and landmark. At 98 rooms covering 64,700 square feet (6,011 m2), it was the largest private residence
    in Canada. It was constructed from 1911 to 1914 as a residence for financier Sir Henry Pellatt. The architect was E. J. Lennox, who designed several other city landmarks. Casa Loma sits at an elevation of 140 metres (460 ft) above sea level. The house
    cost about $3.5 million and took 300 workers three years to build. Notable amenities included an elevator, an oven large enough to cook an ox, two vertical passages for pipe organs, a central vacuum, two secret passages in Pellatt's ground-floor office.
    A pool and three bowling alleys in the basement were never completed. - <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casa_Loma" class="links">Wikipedia </a>
  </p>

  <p class="pp1">
    Sir Henry Pellatt filled Casa Loma with priceless artwork from Canada and around the world. Casa Loma stood as a monument to its creator – it surpassed any private home in North America. With soaring battlements and secret passageways, it paid homage
    to the castles and knights of days gone by. To this day it remains one of the only true castles in North America. Sir Henry Pellatt’s numerous business and military connections demanded entertaining on a large scale. Casa Loma’s romantic borrowing
    from the past, tempered by necessary modern day conveniences, provided the perfect setting. - <a target="_blank" href="https://casaloma.ca/history/" class="links">The Casa Loma Website</a>

  <h2 id="about-pellatt" class="h2s"> About Sir Henry Pellatt </h2>

  <p id="sp">
    Major-General Sir Henry Mill Pellatt, KCVO (January 6, 1859 – March 8, 1939) was a Canadian financier and soldier.
    <br>
    <br> He is notable for his role in bringing hydro-electricity to Toronto, Ontario, for the first time, and also for his large château in Toronto, called Casa Loma, which was the biggest private residence ever constructed in Canada.
    <br>
    <br> Pellatt was born in Kingston, Canada West (now Ontario), the son of Henry Pellatt (1830–1909), a Glasgow-born stockbroker in Toronto, and Emma Mary Pellatt (born in Holland). His great-grandfather was the famous glassmaker Apsley Pellatt.
    <br>

    <br>
    <br> Pellatt had three sisters and two brothers, Fred Pellatt and Mill Pellatt. His sisters were Mary Kate, Marian Maria and Emily Mountford Pellatt.
    <br>
    <br> He was educated at Upper Canada College before leaving in 1876 to join his father's stock brokerage company, Pellatt and Osler, as a clerk. In 1882, Pellatt's father and Osler parted ways, and Pellatt completed his apprenticeship and became a full
    member of the stock exchange.
    <br>
    <br> Pellatt married twice, first to Mary Dodgson, his high school sweetheart, in Toronto in 1882 and, after Mary's death in 1924, to Catharine Welland Merritt in Toronto in 1927, which lasted until her death in 1929. With his first wife, he had one son,
    Reginald, who was born in 1885.
    <br>
    <br> Pellatt enlisted as a rifleman with The Queen's Own Rifles of Canada on November 2, 1876. He rose through the ranks and eventually became the Commanding Officer. In 1905, he was created a Knight Bachelor by King Edward VII for his service with The
    Queen's Own Rifles of Canada.
    <br>
    <br> In 1910, Pellatt took the entire 600-man regiment (including its horses) to England for military training at his expense, to mark the Regiment's 50th anniversary. The military exercises lasted from August 13 to October 3, 1910.
    <br>
    <br> Pellatt later served as the regiment's Honorary Colonel and was promoted to the rank of Major-General upon his retirement from the regiment. In addition, he was made a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (CVO) in 1910.
    <br>
    <br> From 1911 to 1923, he was the Knight Principal of the Imperial Society of Knights Bachelor. - <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Pellatt" class="links">Wikipedia</a> (with some changes made in an attempt to make it shorter)</p>

<h2 id="castle-history" class="h2s">History</h2>

  <p id="hp">
    In 1903, Henry Pellatt purchased 25 lots from developers Kertland and Rolf. Pellatt commissioned architect E. J. Lennox to design Casa Loma. In 1911, construction beganstarting with the massive stables, potting shed and Hunting Lodge (a.k.a. coach-house)
    a few hundred feet north of the main building. The Hunting Lodge is a two-storey 4,380-square-foot (407 m2) house with servants' quarters. As soon as the stable complex was completed, Pellatt sold his summer house in Scarborough to his son and moved
    to the Hunting Lodge. But then due to the start of World War I, construction was halted.
    <br>
    <br>

    <br>
    <br> Most of the third floor was left unfinished, and today serves as the Regimental Museum for The Queen's Own Rifles of Canada. Which Pellatt joined as a Rifleman and rose through the ranks to become the Commanding Officer.
    <br>
    <br> During the depression that followed the war, the City of Toronto increased Casa Loma's property taxes from $600 per year to $1,000 a month, and Pellatt, already experiencing financial difficulties, auctioned off $1.5 million in art and $250,000 in
    furnishings. Pellatt was able to enjoy life in the castle for less than ten years, leaving in 1923.
    <br>
    <br> In the late 1920s, investors operated Casa Loma for a short time as a luxury hotel. During Prohibition, it became a popular nightspot for wealthy Americans. The city seized Casa Loma in 1924 for unpaid taxes, and for years, the building was left
    vacant.
    <br>
    <br> In the 1930s, CFRB broadcaster Claire Wallace spent a night at Casa Loma to gather material for a story about ghosts and supernatural phenomena, and she later broadcast an appeal to save the old building from demolition. Her broadcast was heard by
    the vice-president of a local Kiwanis Club, and subsequently Casa Loma was leased in 1937 by the Kiwanis Club of West Toronto, later Kiwanis Club of Casa Loma (KCCL) , which began operating the castle under a sole-source contract as a tourist destination.
    KCCL managed Casa Loma for 74 years, until 2011.
    <br>
    <br> During World War II, the stables were used to conceal research and production of sonar, and for construction of sonar devices. The area was closed, behind an "Under Repairs" sign. The suggestion that the stables were under renovation allowed workers
    of the secret facility to come and go without suspicion.
    <br>
    <br> From 1997 until 2012, the castle underwent a 15-year, $33-million exterior restoration largely funded by the city. In 2011, the city temporarily resumed management of Casa Loma, because of KCCls inability to help pay for upgrades, and began welcoming
    bids from the private sector in its search for a new operator.
    <br>
    <br> In January 2014, the city entered a new long-term lease and operating agreement with Liberty Entertainment Group, led by President and CEO Nick Di Donato, which agreed to spend $7.4 million to continue the castle's upgrades. - <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casa_Loma" class="links">Wikipedia</a> (with some changes made in an attempt to make it shorter) </p>

  <p id="lp">Sir Henry imported artisans from Europe to design much of the furniture and other features of the castle. Casa Loma has five acres of gardens. An underground tunnel connects Casa Loma to the Hunting Lodge and to the stables (garage, potting shed, stalls,
    carriage room and tack rooms). - <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casa_Loma" class="links">Wikipedia</a> (with some changes made in an attempt to make it shorter) </p>
